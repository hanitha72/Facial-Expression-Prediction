   One of the most exiciting feild in Artificial Intelligence is working with images and video(Video is nothing but set of images). I wanted to do image classification. One of such project is Facial Expression classification.
   
The aim of the project is build a Deep learning network model to train and predict expression of an image and live stream video.
